Kotlin: Kotlin is used as the primary programming language for the application.
Jetpack Compose: The user interface of the app is built using Jetpack Compose, a modern UI toolkit for Android development.
StateFlow & ViewModel: StateFlow and ViewModel are used for state management in the app. This ensures that the game state updates dynamically based on user interactions.
